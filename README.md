# README

This repo holds all my public facing code around realtime video streaming and processing.

- `sample-livestream` is a update to LiveKit's [`android-livestream`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/android-livestream) sample app.
  - Moved to `.kts` build files
  - Using DI and separates concerns a bit more than the original
  - To accompany my conference talks Autumn 2024.
